iOS 0.1_beta

TO BE FIXED:

1. fix the stuttering scroll on first load
2. No error given if internet connection lost after app is launched.
3. Arrows on gallery are useless, make taping any of them take u to the swipe gallery view.
4. Change featured to favourites




for me:
1. add paging on featured like on categories
2. add styling to add lisitng pages (events)
3. Query bug if city is set ot everywhere http://www.geotheme.co.uk/?api=list&city_id=0&type=place&cat_id=47
